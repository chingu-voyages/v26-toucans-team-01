## Sprints

Review of our weekly Sprints. 
Each week the development team met to discuss our progress from the following sprint and lay out the goals for the new sprint.

### Sprint 2 - Foundation

This week we got to work coding the foundation of our project by building out the general structure of the front-end and the initial functions of the javascript which will be calculating user inputs in the background. We also made some adjustments to our git workflow minimize to merge conflicts by streamlining our git branches.

*  Improve code commenting and variable naming
*  Prune unneeded git branches 

### Sprint 3 - Coming together
