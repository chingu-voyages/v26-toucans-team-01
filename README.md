## Overview

This app is being created for the Chingu Voyage 26 team-work.

This is a Mortgage Calculator that allows an estimation of your monthly mortgage payment. You can input a different home price, down payment, loan term and interest rate to see how your monthly payment changes.

## Sprints

Review of our weekly Sprints.
Each week the development team met to discuss our progress from the following sprint and lay out the goals for the new sprint.

### Sprint 1 - Kick off

This week the team met for the first time and discussed our goals for the project. We laid the foundation for how our work flow will look.

#### Sprint 1 goals

- Team introductions
- Brain storm project ideas
- Select a project for the Voyage
- Agree on general look and features of the MVP
- Establish GitHub Repo and branches

### Sprint 2 - Foundation

This week we got to work coding the foundation of our project by building out the general structure of the front-end and the initial functions of the javascript which will be calculating user inputs in the background. We also made some adjustments to our git workflow minimize to merge conflicts by streamlining our git branches.

#### Sprint 2 goals

- Build out initial front-end (html/css)
- Responsive CSS
- Build out backend (JavaScript functions to calculate payments)
- Improve code commenting and variable naming
- Prune unneeded git branches

### Sprint 3 - Coming together

Sprint 2 goals were achieved and the project is currently able to accept user input and display the correct calculated mortgage payment. With the bones of the project in place the team worked on improving the aesthetics, getting closer to our MVP goal.

#### Sprint 3 goals

- Research and decide on graphing for the mortgage data
- Add graph/chart
- Update JS with initial values
- Add a contact page with form
- Add a developers page with the contributors' information
- Add detail to the readme file

### Sprint 4 -

In Sprint 4, we fine-tuned the scope of the project's MVP to provide focus and set a clear vision of success; with these goals in mind, the week proved to be a productive mix of results and communication.

#### Sprint 4 goals

- Refine page responsiveness
- Format values as currency or percentage
- Add navigation bar
- Set up modal views for additional information

### Sprint 5 -

Building on the great progress from Sprint 4, we identified more ways to improve the user experience with modifications to the layout, styles, and inputs.  We also began work on an additional feature to display the 'Advanced Options' section.

#### Sprint 5 goals

- Improve input/label responsiveness per screen size
- Format input to avoid non-numeric errors
- Continue work on navigation and modals

### Sprint 6 - Wrapping Up

Sprint 6 was the final week of our project.  We used it for minor enhancements, testing, and deployment.  We also made time to celebrate our efforts--reflecting on how our team came together in such a short timeframe, built a functional website, and learned a lot along the way.

#### Sprint 6 goals

- Refine responsive menu options
- Set default values on page load
- Add toggle behavior between "Simple Calculator" and "Advanced Options"
- Deploy final project (via netlify)
